# penguins-classification
## Overview

This repository contains the code for a machine learning project focused on the classification of penguins based on various features. In this project, we employed three different machine learning algorithms - Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) - to build predictive models for penguin classification. We also conducted an analysis of model performance using confusion matrices and visualized decision regions for each algorithm.
